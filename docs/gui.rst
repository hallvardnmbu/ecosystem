GUI
=======

The GUI-module is a graphical user interface for the BioSim-package. It is based on the
Tkinter-package, and allows the user to draw a custom map, place animals on the map, and then run
a simulation for a given number of years.

In order to achieve the wanted result, ChatGPT (mostly), Stackoverflow, google and relevant
documentation was used in order to speed up the process of the steep learning curve.

See :mod:`examples` for a demonstration of how to use the GUI as well as some comments on pros
and cons.
