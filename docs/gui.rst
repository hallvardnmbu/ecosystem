GUI
=======

The GUI-module is a graphical user interface for the BioSim-package. It is based on the
PyQt5-package, and allows the user to draw a custom map, place animals on the map, edit the
parameters and then run a simulation for a given number of years.

See :mod:`examples` for a demonstration of how to use the GUI, or try it out yourself by running
the example script ``examples/example_gui.py``.

Note: all of these commands below are "automated", meaning that the user doesn't explicitly call
on any of them. It's all driven by mouse clicks and keyboard input.
