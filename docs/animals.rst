Animals
=======

The Animals-module contains information about the different species of the simulation. Each
species contains information about its parameters and behaviour.

Upon further expansion:
* Create a new subspecies with its own parameters and behaviour.
* Update the feed-method in island.py to include the new species.
* Update the graphics-method in graphics.py to include the new species.
