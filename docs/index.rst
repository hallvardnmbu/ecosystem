      The BioSim package is a framework for modelling biological systems. It is developed as part of
      the course INF200 at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. The package contains tools for a
      relatively simple biological simulation, and is designed to be easily extendable. The
      package is highly customisable, and easy to use.

      It has further been improved in order to provide a seamless experience for users taking the
      ECOL100-course at NMBU.

The package can be installed in terminal using the following command:
