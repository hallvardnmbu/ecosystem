      The BioSim package is a framework for modelling biological systems. It is developed as part of
      the course INF200 at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. The package contains tools for a
      simple biological simulation, and is designed to be easily extendable. The package is highly
      customisable, and easy to use.
