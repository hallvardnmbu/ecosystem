Welcome to BioSim's documentation!
==================================

The BioSim package is a framework for modelling biological systems. It is developed as part of
the course INF200 at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. The package contains tools for a
simple biological simulation, and is designed to be easily extendable. The package is highly
customisable, and easy to use.
